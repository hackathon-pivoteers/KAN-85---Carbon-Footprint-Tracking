## Project Description

The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive Carbon Footprint Tracking system that enables the organization to measure, monitor, and manage their environmental impact. The key features of this system include:

### Data Collection and Integration

- Collects data on energy consumption, transportation, waste generation, and other relevant activities.
- Integrates with IoT devices, energy meters, and external databases for automated data collection.

### Emission Factors Database

- Builds a database of emission factors specific to different industries and activities.

### Carbon Calculation Engine

- Develops a robust calculation engine to quantify carbon emissions based on collected data and emission factors.

### Real-time Monitoring and Alerts

- Implements real-time monitoring features to track carbon emissions continuously.
- Sets up alerts for stakeholders to receive instant feedback on significant emission events.

### Mobile Application

- Develops a mobile application to provide on-the-go access to carbon footprint data and insights.
